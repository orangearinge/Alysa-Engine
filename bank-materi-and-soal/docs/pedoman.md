CONTOH MATERI (REAL LEARNING VERSION)
Materi 1: Fluency & Coherence
📘 Content 1: What is Fluency?

Explanation:
Fluency refers to your ability to speak continuously without unnatural pauses or hesitation. In IELTS Speaking, fluency does not mean speaking very fast. Instead, it means speaking at a natural speed while clearly expressing your ideas.

Many candidates lose marks because they stop too often, repeat words excessively, or struggle to continue their answers. Short pauses are acceptable, but long silences should be avoided.

Example:
❌ “I like my hometown… um… because… it is… nice.”
✅ “I like my hometown because it is a peaceful place with friendly people.”

📘 Content 2: What is Coherence?

Explanation:
Coherence is about organizing ideas logically so that the listener can easily follow what you are saying. This is achieved by using linking words and phrases to connect ideas smoothly.

Common linking words include: and, but, because, however, for example, in my opinion.

Example:

“I enjoy my job because it allows me to meet new people. Moreover, it helps me improve my communication skills.”

📘 Content 3: Common Fluency Problems

Explanation:
Some common fluency problems include overusing fillers such as “uh,” “um,” or repeating the same idea multiple times. These habits reduce clarity and coherence.

Instead, candidates should practice extending answers naturally and using simple connectors.

Example Tip:
Instead of stopping, add a reason or example:

“I like reading because it helps me relax after work.”
