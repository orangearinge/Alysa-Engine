1,sp1,What is Fluency?,"Fluency refers to your ability to speak continuously without unnatural pauses or hesitation. In IELTS Speaking, fluency does not mean speaking very fast. Instead, it means speaking at a natural speed while clearly expressing your ideas. Many candidates lose marks because they stop too often, repeat words excessively, or struggle to continue their answers. Short pauses are acceptable, but long silences should be avoided. Example: ❌ 'I like my hometown… um… because… it is… nice.' ✅ 'I like my hometown because it is a peaceful place with friendly people.'",NULL
2,sp1,What is Coherence?,"Coherence is about organizing ideas logically so that the listener can easily follow what you are saying. This is achieved by using linking words and phrases to connect ideas smoothly. Common linking words include: and, but, because, however, for example, in my opinion. Example: 'I enjoy my job because it allows me to meet new people. Moreover, it helps me improve my communication skills.'",NULL
3,sp1,Common Fluency Problems,"Some common fluency problems include overusing fillers such as 'uh,' 'um,' or repeating the same idea multiple times. These habits reduce clarity and coherence. Instead, candidates should practice extending answers naturally and using simple connectors. Example Tip: Instead of stopping, add a reason or example: 'I like reading because it helps me relax after work.'",quiz_sp1
4,sp2,Understanding Pronunciation,"Pronunciation is about how clearly you produce individual sounds in English. It's not about having a native accent, but about being understood. Focus on problematic sounds like /θ/ (think), /ð/ (this), /v/ (very), and /w/ (water). Practice minimal pairs: ship/sheep, bad/bed, walk/work. Clear pronunciation helps examiners understand you better.",NULL
5,sp2,Word Stress & Sentence Stress,"English uses stress to convey meaning. Word stress: PHOtograph (noun) vs phoTOgraphy (noun) vs photoGRAPHic (adjective). Sentence stress: Content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) are stressed, while function words (articles, prepositions) are unstressed. Example: 'I WENT to the STORE to BUY some MILK.' Proper stress makes your speech sound natural.",NULL
6,sp2,Intonation Patterns,"Intonation is the rise and fall of your voice. Rising intonation (↗) is used for yes/no questions: 'Do you like coffee?↗' Falling intonation (↘) is used for statements and wh-questions: 'I love coffee.↘' 'Where do you live?↘' Good intonation shows confidence and helps convey your meaning clearly.",quiz_sp2
7,sp3,Using Varied Vocabulary,"Instead of repeating the same words, use synonyms and paraphrases. For example, instead of saying 'good' repeatedly, use: excellent, wonderful, fantastic, beneficial, advantageous. Instead of 'important': crucial, vital, significant, essential. This demonstrates your lexical resource and impresses examiners.",NULL
8,sp3,Topic-Specific Vocabulary,"Prepare vocabulary for common IELTS topics: Work (career prospects, job satisfaction, work-life balance), Education (curriculum, academic performance, extracurricular activities), Environment (pollution, sustainability, carbon footprint), Technology (innovation, digital age, automation). Having topic-specific words ready helps you speak more confidently.",NULL
9,sp3,Idiomatic Expressions & Collocations,"Use natural English expressions: 'make a decision' (not 'do a decision'), 'heavy rain' (not 'strong rain'), 'do homework' (not 'make homework'). Common idioms: 'it's a piece of cake' (very easy), 'hit the books' (study hard), 'break the ice' (start a conversation). Use these naturally, not forcefully.",quiz_sp3
10,sp4,Using Complex Sentences,"Combine simple sentences using conjunctions: Although it was raining, I went for a walk. Use relative clauses: The book that I read yesterday was fascinating. Conditional sentences: If I had more time, I would travel more. Complex sentences show grammatical range and help you achieve higher band scores.",NULL
11,sp4,Tense Accuracy,"Use correct tenses: Present Perfect for experiences: 'I have visited Paris three times.' Past Simple for completed actions: 'I visited Paris last year.' Present Continuous for current actions: 'I am studying for IELTS.' Future forms: 'I will take the test next month' or 'I am going to study tonight.' Tense errors can lower your score.",NULL
12,sp4,Common Grammar Mistakes,"Avoid these errors: Subject-verb agreement: 'He goes' (not 'He go'). Articles: 'I am a student' (not 'I am student'). Prepositions: 'interested in' (not 'interested about'). Plural forms: 'children' (not 'childs'). Practice these patterns until they become automatic.",quiz_sp4
13,sp5,Understanding Part 2 Format,"In Speaking Part 2, you receive a topic card and have 1 minute to prepare, then speak for 1-2 minutes. The card contains: main topic, 3-4 bullet points to cover, and a final question (usually 'explain why' or 'how you feel'). You must address all points. Use your preparation time wisely to note keywords, not full sentences.",NULL
14,sp5,Structuring Your Response,"Use this structure: Introduction (5-10 seconds): Briefly introduce the topic. Main Body (60-90 seconds): Cover each bullet point with details, examples, and descriptions. Conclusion (10-15 seconds): Summarize or explain your feelings. Example structure: 'I'd like to talk about... First of all... Another point is... Finally... Overall, I feel...'",NULL
15,sp5,Extension Techniques,"If you run out of ideas, use these techniques: Give examples: 'For instance, last summer...' Compare: 'Compared to other places...' Explain reasons: 'The reason why I chose this is...' Describe feelings: 'It made me feel...' Add details: 'What I particularly remember is...' These help you speak for the full 2 minutes.",quiz_sp5
16,wr1,Understanding Task 1 Requirements,"IELTS Writing Task 1 requires you to describe visual information (graphs, charts, tables, diagrams, maps) in 150+ words within 20 minutes. You must: identify main trends, make comparisons, report key features, and use accurate data. Don't give opinions or reasons - just report what you see objectively.",NULL
17,wr1,Understanding Task 2 Requirements,"Task 2 is an essay (250+ words, 40 minutes) where you respond to a point of view, argument, or problem. You must: fully address all parts of the question, present a clear position, support ideas with relevant examples, and maintain a formal academic style. Task 2 is worth twice as much as Task 1.",NULL
18,wr1,Analyzing the Question,"Before writing, spend 2-3 minutes analyzing: What type of question is it? (opinion, discussion, problem-solution, advantages-disadvantages). What are the key words? How many parts must you address? What is your position? Planning prevents you from going off-topic, which severely impacts your Task Achievement score.",quiz_wr1
19,wr2,Paragraph Structure,"Each paragraph should have: Topic sentence (main idea), Supporting sentences (explanations, examples, evidence), Concluding sentence (summary or transition). Example: 'Firstly, technology has improved communication. (topic) People can now connect instantly via smartphones and social media. (support) This has made the world more interconnected. (conclusion)'",NULL
20,wr2,Cohesive Devices,"Use linking words to connect ideas: Addition (furthermore, moreover, in addition), Contrast (however, nevertheless, on the other hand), Cause-Effect (therefore, consequently, as a result), Example (for instance, such as, namely), Sequence (firstly, secondly, finally). Don't overuse them - one per sentence maximum.",NULL
21,wr2,Logical Organization,"Task 1: Introduction (paraphrase the question), Overview (main trends), Body paragraphs (detailed features). Task 2: Introduction (background + thesis), Body paragraph 1 (first main idea), Body paragraph 2 (second main idea), Conclusion (summarize position). Clear organization helps examiners follow your argument.",quiz_wr2
22,wr3,Academic Vocabulary,"Use formal academic words: 'children' (not 'kids'), 'purchase' (not 'buy'), 'numerous' (not 'lots of'), 'individuals' (not 'people' - sometimes), 'beneficial' (not 'good'). Avoid contractions (don't → do not), phrasal verbs (find out → discover), and informal expressions (a lot of → many/much).",NULL
23,wr3,Paraphrasing Skills,"Paraphrase the question in your introduction: Question: 'Some people think technology makes life easier.' Paraphrase: 'It is argued that technological advances simplify daily life.' Use synonyms: increase → rise, important → significant, problem → issue. Change word forms: educate (verb) → education (noun), happy (adjective) → happiness (noun).",NULL
24,wr3,Avoiding Repetition,"Don't repeat the same words. Use pronouns (it, they, this), synonyms (students → learners → pupils), and paraphrases (climate change → global warming → environmental crisis). Example: 'Education is important. It plays a vital role in society. This fundamental aspect of development...' shows lexical variety.",quiz_wr3
25,wr4,Sentence Variety,"Mix simple, compound, and complex sentences: Simple: 'Education is important.' Compound: 'Education is important, and it benefits society.' Complex: 'Although education is expensive, it benefits society.' Complex-compound: 'While education is expensive, it benefits society, and governments should fund it.' Variety demonstrates grammatical range.",NULL
26,wr4,Advanced Grammar Structures,"Use these for higher bands: Passive voice: 'The data was collected in 2020.' Conditionals: 'If governments invested more, education would improve.' Relative clauses: 'Students who study hard achieve better results.' Participle clauses: 'Having studied the data, we can conclude...' Inversion: 'Not only does it help, but it also...'",NULL
27,wr4,Error-Free Writing,"Common errors to avoid: Subject-verb agreement: 'The number of students is increasing' (not 'are'). Articles: 'The internet' (specific), 'a computer' (general). Prepositions: 'depend on' (not 'depend of'). Plural forms: 'criteria' (not 'criterias'). Proofread for 2-3 minutes to catch mistakes.",quiz_wr4
28,wr5,Opinion Essays,"Question type: 'To what extent do you agree or disagree?' Structure: Introduction (paraphrase + clear opinion), Body 1 (first reason + example), Body 2 (second reason + example), Conclusion (restate opinion). Be clear: 'I completely agree...' or 'I partially agree...' Don't sit on the fence without justification.",NULL
29,wr5,Discussion Essays,"Question type: 'Discuss both views and give your opinion.' Structure: Introduction (paraphrase + mention both views), Body 1 (first view + reasons), Body 2 (second view + reasons), Body 3 (your opinion) OR include opinion in conclusion. Present both sides fairly before stating your position.",NULL
30,wr5,Problem-Solution Essays,"Question type: 'What are the problems and solutions?' Structure: Introduction (introduce issue), Body 1 (problems + explanations), Body 2 (solutions + explanations), Conclusion (summarize). Example: Problems: traffic congestion, pollution. Solutions: public transport investment, carpooling incentives. Match solutions to specific problems.",quiz_wr5
31,li1,Listening for Names & Spelling,"Names are often spelled out in Section 1. Listen carefully for: letter-by-letter spelling ('My name is Sarah, S-A-R-A-H'), clarifications ('That's P for Peter, not B for Bob'), double letters ('Bennett, with double T'). Write as you hear and check spelling. Capitalization matters: names, places, days, months are capitalized.",NULL
32,li1,Catching Numbers & Dates,"Numbers appear frequently: phone numbers (usually in groups: 0207-946-3852), prices (£15.50 or $99.99), dates (15th May or May 15th), times (3:30 pm or 15:30). Listen for: 'double' (77), 'triple' (888), 'oh' vs 'zero'. Write numbers as digits unless specified otherwise. Practice listening to various number formats.",NULL
33,li1,Identifying Specific Details,"Focus on question keywords before listening. If the question asks for a 'color', listen for color words. If it asks 'when', listen for time expressions. Details include: addresses (23 Park Road), room numbers (Room 401), reference numbers (ID: 7834B). Information usually comes in order, so track your position.",quiz_li1
34,li2,Understanding Context & Purpose,"Before each section, read the context: 'You will hear a conversation between a student and a librarian.' This tells you: who is speaking, where they are, why they're talking. Understanding context helps you predict vocabulary and content. Listen for the speaker's purpose: requesting, complaining, explaining, suggesting.",NULL
35,li2,Identifying Main Ideas,"The main idea is the overall point or topic. Listen for: topic sentences at the start, repeated themes, emphasized words (stress/intonation), summary statements at the end. Example: If speakers discuss 'benefits of exercise, types of exercise, and exercise tips,' the main idea is 'exercise and health.' Don't get distracted by minor details.",NULL
36,li2,Distinguishing Main vs Supporting Points,"Main points answer 'what is this mainly about?' Supporting points provide details, examples, or explanations. Example: Main: 'The library will close for renovations.' Supporting: 'It will close on June 1st, renovations will take 3 months, books can be returned via drop box.' Focus on main points for heading/title questions.",quiz_li2
37,li3,Map Vocabulary & Directions,"Essential words: Directions (north, south, east, west), Positions (next to, opposite, between, behind, in front of), Landmarks (entrance, exit, reception, car park). Example: 'The café is located to the east of the main entrance, opposite the library.' Draw simple arrows as you listen to track movements.",NULL
38,li3,Following Route Descriptions,"Listen for sequence words: 'First, go straight ahead. Then, turn left at the traffic lights. After that, you'll see the bank on your right.' Track the route on the map as you listen. Mark each instruction: arrows for directions, X for destinations. If you get lost, skip ahead and catch the next landmark.",NULL
39,li3,Labeling Maps & Plans,"Maps show: buildings, rooms, streets, facilities. You must label specific locations (A, B, C, etc.) with correct names. Strategy: Preview the map, identify fixed points (entrance, north arrow), predict what might be labeled (shops, offices, facilities). Listen for position words and match them to the map.",quiz_li3
40,li4,Note Completion Strategy,"Notes have gaps for missing information. Before listening: read the notes, predict what type of word is needed (noun, number, date), identify keywords around gaps. While listening: write exactly what you hear (spelling counts), don't change word forms, stay within word limits (e.g., 'NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS').",NULL
41,li4,Form & Table Completion,"Forms/tables organize information in categories: Name, Date, Price, Location, etc. Strategy: scan the form structure, note what information is needed for each field, listen for keywords that signal each category. Example: 'Name: ___' → listen for 'My name is...' or 'I'm...' Write clearly and check spelling.",NULL
42,li4,Sentence Completion Tips,"Complete sentences must be grammatically correct. Check: Does it need a noun, verb, or adjective? Is it singular or plural? Does it fit the meaning? Example: 'The course starts in ___.' (needs a time/month). Listen for: 'The course will begin in September.' Answer: September. Grammar and meaning must match.",quiz_li4
43,li5,Multiple Choice Strategy,"Read questions and options before listening. Underline keywords in the question. Listen for paraphrases - the audio won't use exact words from options. Example: Option: 'It's expensive.' Audio: 'It costs too much' or 'It's not affordable.' Eliminate wrong answers as you listen. Don't choose just because you hear a word from the option.",NULL
44,li5,Avoiding Distractors,"Distractors are wrong answers designed to trick you. Common tricks: mentioning words from wrong options, giving information then correcting it ('I thought it was Monday, but actually it's Tuesday'), partial truth (option mentions 2 points but only 1 is correct). Always listen to the complete answer before choosing.",NULL
45,li5,Managing Time in Multiple Choice,"You have time before each section to read questions. Use it wisely: read the question, read all options, underline keywords, predict possible answers. If you miss a question, guess and move on - don't let it affect the next questions. All questions carry equal marks, so don't spend too long on one.",quiz_li5
46,re1,What is Skimming?,"Skimming means reading quickly to get the general idea without reading every word. Focus on: title, headings, first and last sentences of paragraphs, topic sentences, repeated words. Don't stop at unknown words. Goal: understand the main topic and overall structure in 2-3 minutes. Skimming helps you locate information faster later.",NULL
47,re1,Identifying Topic Sentences,"The topic sentence (usually first or second sentence of a paragraph) states the main idea. Example: 'Climate change poses serious threats to biodiversity. Rising temperatures affect animal habitats...' Topic sentence: 'Climate change poses serious threats to biodiversity.' The rest provides supporting details. Identify these to understand paragraph structure.",NULL
48,re1,Finding Main Ideas Quickly,"Read: title (gives overall topic), introduction (provides background), first sentence of each paragraph (main point), conclusion (summary). Skip examples and detailed explanations on first reading. Example: If paragraph starts 'There are three main causes of pollution,' you know it will list 3 causes - you can skim the details.",quiz_re1
49,re2,What is Scanning?,"Scanning means searching for specific information like names, dates, numbers, or keywords. Your eyes move quickly over the text until you find the target. Like using Ctrl+F on a computer. You don't read everything - just locate the specific detail. Useful for: True/False/Not Given, matching, completion tasks.",NULL
50,re2,Scanning Techniques,"Look for: Capital letters (names, places), Numbers (dates, statistics), Special formatting (bold, italics), Keywords from questions. Example: Question asks about 'Dr. Smith's research in 2019.' Scan for 'Dr. Smith' or '2019.' When you find it, read that sentence carefully. Don't read the whole paragraph unless needed.",NULL
51,re2,Using Keywords Effectively,"Identify keywords in questions, then scan for synonyms in the text. Question: 'What is the main benefit of exercise?' Keywords: benefit, exercise. Text might say: 'The primary advantage of physical activity is...' (benefit = advantage, exercise = physical activity). Practice recognizing paraphrases to scan effectively.",quiz_re2
52,re3,Understanding True/False/Not Given,"True: Statement matches the text exactly or is clearly implied. False: Statement contradicts the text. Not Given: Information is not mentioned or there's insufficient information to confirm. Example: Text: 'The museum opens at 9am.' Statement: 'The museum opens at 8am.' = False. Statement: 'The museum is popular.' = Not Given (no information about popularity).",NULL
53,re3,Common Mistakes to Avoid,"Don't use outside knowledge - only use information in the text. Don't assume - if it's not stated or clearly implied, it's Not Given. Don't confuse False and Not Given: False = contradicts text, Not Given = no information. Example: Text: 'Some students study hard.' Statement: 'All students study hard.' = False (contradicts 'some').",NULL
54,re3,Step-by-Step Approach,"1. Read the statement carefully. 2. Identify keywords. 3. Scan the text for those keywords or synonyms. 4. Read that section carefully. 5. Compare: Does it match (True), contradict (False), or is there no information (Not Given)? 6. Don't spend more than 1 minute per question. 7. If unsure, guess and move on.",quiz_re3
55,re4,Understanding Heading Questions,"You must match headings (i, ii, iii, etc.) to paragraphs (A, B, C, etc.). Headings summarize the main idea of the paragraph. There are usually more headings than paragraphs - some are distractors. Read all headings first, then read each paragraph and match. Cross out used headings to avoid confusion.",NULL
56,re4,Identifying Paragraph Main Ideas,"Read the first two sentences and last sentence of the paragraph - the main idea is usually there. Ignore examples and minor details. Look for: topic sentences, repeated themes, concluding statements. Example: Paragraph discusses 'benefits of solar energy, cost savings, environmental impact.' Heading: 'Advantages of renewable energy.' Match!",NULL
57,re4,Avoiding Heading Traps,"Distractors use keywords from the paragraph but don't represent the main idea. Example: Paragraph main idea: 'Benefits of exercise.' Distractor heading: 'Types of exercise' (mentioned but not the main point). True heading: 'Health advantages of physical activity.' Focus on the overall message, not just keywords. Read the whole paragraph before deciding.",quiz_re4
58,re5,Summary Completion Strategy,"Summaries condense the main points of a text or section. Read the summary first to understand the context. Identify what type of word is needed (noun, verb, adjective). Check word limits (e.g., 'ONE WORD ONLY'). Scan the text for the relevant section. Copy words exactly as they appear - don't change forms.",NULL
59,re5,Sentence Completion Tips,"Completed sentences must be grammatically correct and make sense. Check: subject-verb agreement, singular/plural, tense. Example: 'The researchers discovered that ___.' (needs a noun clause or noun). Text: 'The researchers discovered that pollution levels had increased.' Answer: 'pollution levels had increased' (if word limit allows) or 'pollution levels' (if limit is 2 words).",NULL
60,re5,Maintaining Accuracy,"Common mistakes: exceeding word limit (if it says TWO WORDS, you can't write three), changing word forms (text says 'children,' you write 'child'), spelling errors (copy exactly from text), using synonyms (use exact words from text). Always check: word limit, spelling, grammar. Accuracy is crucial - wrong spelling = wrong answer.",quiz_re5
